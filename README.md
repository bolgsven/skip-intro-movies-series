## Introduction to Skip Intro Python Script

This Python script utilizes the `moviepy` library to manipulate video files and automate the process of skipping predefined intro segments. The `skip_intro` function is designed to enhance the viewing experience by eliminating the need to manually fast-forward through repetitive intro sequences in movies and TV series.

### How It Works:
The function takes three arguments: the path to the video file (`video_path`), the duration of the intro in seconds (`intro_duration`), and the path where the modified video will be saved (`output_path`). By specifying the intro duration, the script efficiently skips the intro and starts playback from the desired point, thereby saving time and improving viewer convenience.

The code snippet below demonstrates a simple yet effective method for cutting out the intro part of a video using `VideoFileClip` from `moviepy.editor`. This is particularly useful for users who regularly watch series or movies and want to bypass repetitive content.

### Example Usage:
The provided example demonstrates how to skip the first 90 seconds of a video, which can be adjusted according to the length of the intro for different videos.

**Note**: This script assumes a fixed intro duration and does not automatically detect intro segments. For automatic intro detection, further development with more complex algorithms or machine learning techniques would be required.

Feel free to adapt and extend the functionality as needed for your specific use cases.


```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip

def skip_intro(video_path, intro_duration, output_path):
    video = VideoFileClip(video_path)
    # Skipping the intro by cutting from the end of the intro to the end of the video
    no_intro_video = video.subclip(intro_duration, video.duration)
    no_intro_video.write_videofile(output_path, codec='libx264', audio_codec='aac')

# Example usage:
skip_intro("path_to_your_movie.mp4", 90, "output_without_intro.mp4")  # Skips the first 90 seconds
